# MOBILE-DEVELOPMENT
The Mobile Development (MD) team is responsible for creating a functional Android application. The YogaScan app will feature 9 menus: Sign Up, Sign In, Home, Detail Pose, Scan, Profile, Edit Profile, History, and Favorite. The main feature offered in the YogaScan app is the "Scan" menu, where we utilize machine learning to analyze yoga movements in real-time. 

Additionally, there are supporting features such as adding favorite poses, viewing the history of performed poses, and accessing detailed information about each pose, including brief explanations and health benefits for the body.
# LOGO
To align with our app's goals, we intended to create a logo involving a Yoga Pose with scanning features. Ultimately, we developed two distinct logo concepts, each featuring different alternate colors, which will be voted on by our team members.

**Logo Deliverable**

After conducting online voting and group discussions, we have decided to choose the second logo design with the blue color combination.

**Logo Description :**

The YogaScan logo features a circular base with a gradient or combination of blue colors inside, creating a calming and harmonious effect. At the center of the circle, there is a silhouette of an individual performing a yoga asana pose with their raised hands, conveying balance, tranquility, and focus. This silhouette sits atop a lotus flower, a common symbol in yoga representing purity, enlightenment, and spiritual growth. Around the edge of the circle, still within its bounds, there is a white line that curves as if scanning or analyzing the individual within. This line reflects the advanced technology used in the YogaScan app to evaluate users' yoga postures and movements in real-time.

**Logo Meaning :**

**1. Blue Circle :**
- The blue color symbolizes tranquility, peace, and balance, which are core principles of yoga practice.
- The circular shape represents unity and perfect wholeness, depicting harmony between body and mind.
  
**2. Yoga Asana Silhouette :**
- This silhouette emphasizes the primary focus of the application, which is to assist users in practicing yoga poses correctly.
- The raised hands symbolize achievement, freedom, and connection to higher energy.
  
**3. Lotus Flower :**
- The lotus is a classic symbol in yoga representing purity, enlightenment, and spiritual growth.
- Its use signifies that the application focuses not only on physical health but also on the spiritual development of the user.
  
**4. White Scan Line :**
- The circular white line illustrates the scanning process conducted by the app to evaluate users' yoga postures in real-time.
- It signifies the advanced technology and innovative features of YogaScan, enabling users to receive direct and accurate feedback on their yoga poses.

For the fonts, we use two different fonts for the application name and its slogan.

**1. Font "Berkshire Swash" for "YogaScan" text :**

The combined use of these fonts creates a balanced impression between tradition and modernity, presenting an elegant yet user-friendly image for the application. With this design, the YogaScan logo reflects its goal to provide an easy, efficient, and advanced way for users to practice yoga, while integrating the core elements of tranquility, balance, and enlightenment that are central to yoga practice.

# USER INTERFACE

We did most of the work in Figma, so please check the link for more details at [http://bit.ly/Yogascan_UIUX](http://bit.ly/Yogascan_UIUX). In short, we began by creating low-fidelity designs for key pages such as Sign Up, Sign In, Home, Detail Pose, Scan, Profile, Edit Profile, History, and Favorite. These designs aimed to establish the basic structure and layout of essential elements on each page without focusing too much on visual details. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, some old frames were deleted and not documented beforehand.

After completing the low-fidelity designs, we proceeded to the high-fidelity design phase. Here, we focused on developing deeper visual details and a more interactive user experience. This phase included pages such as Home, Scan, History, and Favorite, which were revised to match the color palette and visual identity of the established YogaScan logo. Here's a glimpse of the latest UI design for the YogaScan app.
